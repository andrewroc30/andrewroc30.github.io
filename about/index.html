<div class="About"</h1>
	<p>My name is Andrew Rocchi, I'm a 3rd year undergraduate computer science student at Northeastern University, 
	    working towards a Masters by the end of year 5.  At the moment, I am on a 6 month Co-op at Welltok as a 
	    software engineer, working on their Cafewell product.  More specifically, I am migrating over the webserver,
	    and converting the codebase to run via Docker and deploy using Kubernetes with Deis.  In my free time, I enjoy
	    rock climbing, hiking, snowboarding, videogames, and coding.</p>
