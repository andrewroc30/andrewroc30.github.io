<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<div class="Work Experience">
    <ul>
        <li>July - December 202: I worked at Avigilon as a cloud services software engineer.  I was put onto the DevOps team where I created several PowerShell scripts and worked with Azure.  One notable thing I did here was create a script which removed logs from web servers to clear up their disk space (which was running out at the time).  The script allowed for customization of pattern-matching on log names and locations, and had options to move the logs to blob storage in Azure, download them locally, or just to delete them outright.  This was run with Azure automation for each server, eliminating the disk space issue.</li>
        <li>July - December 2019: I worked at Welltok as a software engineer, working on their Cafewell product. More specifically, I migrated over the webserver, and converted the codebase to run via Docker and deploy using Kubernetes with Deis.</li>
        <li>September - December 2018: I worked for Northeastern University as a grader for Fundamentals of Computer Science</li>
        <li>August 2018: I worked for Ithacan Media as a Game Designer/Programmer.  I led design on the 'Black Hole', the social media portion of the game, and programmed a working prototype in Unity C#.</li>
