Project Euler is a popular site which contains many short coding problems to be solved.  The problems start out easy, with the 5% difficulty problems not requiring much effort, but they quickly ramp up in difficulty from there.  For a bit of perspective, there are 901020 people who have solved the 1st question, and 115 people who have solved the 566th question.  Additionally, this graph of the number of questions solved by people (from [projecteuler.net/problem_analysis](https://projecteuler.net/problem_analysis)).

Solving these problems can be pretty enjoyable, especially getting that wave of joy seeing that big green check mark after entering the correct solution to a problem.  A lot of these problems aren't too hard to solve in terms of making an algorithm that can get the answer, although for the more difficult questions that can be a challenge too.  Perhaps a more prohibitive issue is how there is the 'one-minute rule', which means that every one of these problems can have a solution calculated for it in under a minute on a modestly powered computer.  For the questions that I've done so far, I've ended up spending my time 50/50 on average between finding a successful algorithm and finding an efficient one.  For many problems, I am content with getting an answer in under 10 minutes without looking at the forums for how other people solved the problem efficiently.

All in all, this site provides many fun challenges for coding in my free time.

I have most of my code in a private repository [here](https://github.com/andrewroc30/Project-Euler), but try to keep from showing it to others to keep the integrity of the site, and leave the fun of solving the problem to others.
