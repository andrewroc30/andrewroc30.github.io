In the summer of 2013, I had just been introduced to the game engine named [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/).  At this point, I didn't have any programming knowledge or really any experience with creating anything at all, so these were more like my first attempts to get something on the screen at all for nothing more than my own entertainment.  As you might expect, these were some horrendous games in just about every aspect that you could imagine.  Feel free to give it a shot, but don't blame me if you give up frustrated!
